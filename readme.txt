== Changelog ==

= 1.2 =
Russian localization is added.

The pop-up window (many have counted its superfluous) is removed

Now 3 operation modes are accessible:

1. All links (installed in line URL) to make DoFollow

2. To leave the last link DoFollow, remaining to make inactive

3. To make inactive all links except what are described in a special field. In this field you can add addresses of blogs of friends or тез people to whom you trust who leaves really qualitative comments.

Inactive links can conduct now themselves with 3 different methods:

1. To go through Redirect

2. To be substituted with the text (the name of the author, without the link is simple)

3. Redirect through own page (which, by the way, can be issued somehow). 

One more important detail is added: it is possible to include an option that by search of the last comment the comment of the manager wasn't considered. That is, if the last comment is left by the manager DoFollow there will be a comment of other user previous it.
